/**
 * The idea for this class was to have a generator capable of generating
 * clusters of points that would not be entirely spherical. In particular, this
 * implementation generates clusters that consist of paired overlapping Gaussian
 * distributions. Additionally, there will be a difference in relative density
 * between the two Gaussian generated volumes, so that the centroid would not be
 * well centered. This makes for an interesting test-shape for clustering.
