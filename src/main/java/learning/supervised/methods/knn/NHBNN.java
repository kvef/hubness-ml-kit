/**
 * This class implements the Naive Hubness-Bayesian k-nearest neighbor algorithm
 * that was proposed in the following paper: A Probabilistic Approach to
 * Nearest-Neighbor Classification: Naive Hubness Bayesian kNN by Nenad Tomasev,
 * Milos Radovanovic, Dunja Mladenic and Mirjana Ivanovic, presented at the
 * Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) in 2011 in Glasgow.
 * It is a Naive Bayesian interpretation of the k-nearest neighbor rule. Each
 * neighbor occurrence is interpreted as an event, as a new defining feature for
 * the query inst
